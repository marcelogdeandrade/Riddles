# Creating Riddles

Create a file names `riddles.js` that contains a list of objects riddles.

Each object has an image url, a label and an answer.
File example:

```
const ImagePaths = [
    {
        image: "https://images.pexels.com/photos/1068523/pexels-photo-1068523.jpeg",
        label: "People",
        answer: "happy"
    },
    {
        image: "https://images.pexels.com/photos/864994/pexels-photo-864994.jpeg",
        label: "Tech",
        answer: "dog"
    } 
]

export default ImagePaths
```

This file is on `.gitignore` so it becomes secret. It is the only private file you can't show anyone.

The rest of the code is shareable.
